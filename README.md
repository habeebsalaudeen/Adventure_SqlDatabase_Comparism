# Adventure_SqlDatabase_Comparism
This project showcases SQL database version comparison skills using Devart SQL Compare to analyze schema and object changes between two versions of the AdventureWorks database: SQL Server 2008R2 and SQL Server 2019.
 The project highlights changes in database structure, 
feature enhancements, deprecated elements, and improved design practices. This comparison helps data professionals understand how SQL Server evolves and how legacy databases can be upgraded effectively.

# DATABASE SETUP AND COMPARISON TOOL
Tools Used:
Devart SQL Compare, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and AdventureWorks sample databases.

Source & Target:

Source: AdventureWorks2008R2

Target: AdventureWorks2019

Comparison Focus:

Tables

Views

Stored Procedures

Functions

Indexes

Data types

Security elements like roles and permissions

# SCHEMA COMPARISON & OBJECT CHANGES
Using SQL Compare, we performed an in-depth comparison between both database versions. Key differences included:

# New Tables and Modified Schemas:
AdventureWorks2019 includes additional tables such as DatabaseLog, updated columns in Employee, and improved normalization in some lookup tables.

# Stored Procedures:
Several procedures were modified or deprecated, with improved logic and optimized queries.

# Views and Functions:
Views were updated to reflect changes in underlying tables. Scalar functions saw better implementation in the 2019 version.

# VISUAL COMPARISON SNAPSHOT
Using Devart SQL Compare's UI (see attached screenshot), we clearly identified:

Objects only in 2019 or 2008R2

Modified definitions (highlighted differences)

Script previews to synchronize schema changes

This visual tool helps ensure smoother migrations, detects potential compatibility issues, and allows DBAs to generate deployment scripts.

# INSIGHTS & TAKEAWAYS
Backward Compatibility Issues:
Some deprecated features in 2008R2 were removed or replaced in 2019, necessitating refactoring during migration.

Performance Optimization:
The 2019 schema is more performance-conscious, with additional indexes and better normalization.

Data Governance Improvements:
Role management and permission sets in 2019 promote better security practices.

Evolution of SQL Server Features:
New features like temporal tables and inline table-valued functions, though not directly reflected in AdventureWorks2019, show SQL Server's capabilities beyond 2008R2.

# CONCLUSION
This AdventureWorks SQL comparison project illustrates how enterprise-level databases evolve over time and the practical use of tools like SQL Compare in managing upgrades, migrations, and audits. 
The comparison offers valuable insights into schema design changes, performance improvements, and security updates from SQL Server 2008R2 to 2019.
